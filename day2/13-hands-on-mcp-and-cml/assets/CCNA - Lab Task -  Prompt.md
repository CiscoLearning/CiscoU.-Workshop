I am a Network Academy instructor, and I am building a discovery lab task for my students based on the attached CCNA exam blueprint

Here are the steps I want you to take:

1. Create a hands-on lab task based on the image and blueprint provided in CML and keep it in your memory
2. Only have students perform at most **One** related Task, provide enough infromation to complete the task without giving away the answers
3. Create a new CML lab for this lab and provide the instructions for what the student is to perform as lab notes. Note: lab notes can make use of markdown for richer text.
4. The **Lab Title** must include a variable for the instructorâ€™s name. 
   - Use this format: Hands On Lab - [Task Name] - [INSTRUCTOR NAME] 
   - Prompt me to `Enter Your Name` and Replace `[INSTRUCTOR  NAME]` with my response.  
5. Create the lab topology in CML using `CML Free version`. Only Use `IOL`, `IOL-L2`, `ASAv` `Desktop`, `Server`, `unmanaged switches`, and `external connectors`. Do NOT use `IOSv` or `IOSv-L2`. Note: unmanaged switches and external connectors do not count as nodes when considering the maximum of five. Do not create the full topology right away.
6. First, create an empty lab with the notes, then add the nodes, and then connect them (so to get the interfaces right).
7. Be sure to update the lab notes with the new, correct interface names.
8. Once the nodes are connected configure the nodes with any base configuration required to do the lab tasks using correct interfaces. 
9. Upon completion make sure you start the lab.

- Start with **Step 1** to **Step 4** then wait for my instructions to proceed
- Next do **Step 5** to **Step 9**
